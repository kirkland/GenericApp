== Generic App

I am making this app for me only, but would be very pleased if anyone else found it useful. I created this app because there are some common tasks I always do when starting a new Rails project. I want instead to automate the following:

-- commonly used gems
-- setting up Authlogic
-- set up HAML and SASS

This app is setup with the name GenericApp, so after cloning it, you'll want to replace any occurence of GenericApp with YourAppName, and geneneric_app with your_app_name. Included is a simple ruby program, setup.rb, which will accomplish this. Simply run it, and pass as a parameter your app name, in CamelCase. For example: ./setup.rb MyAwesomeApp
